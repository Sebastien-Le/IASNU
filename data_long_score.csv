We live at 18-19°C without any problems","I limit my meat consumption overall. Now I don't see myself going without eggs and dairy products. The answer to limiting GHGs in the food sector is in my opinion far from being a simple switch to an all-vegetable diet. Before turning completely in one direction or another, we should have a complete visibility of the impacts of such a choice (transport, nutrition, water consumption (e.g. almonds)). Apart from ethical criteria, it is not certain that one kg of chicken raised with local food and consumed in a household in the South is more ""carbon intensive"" than one kg of protein crops produced in an energy-intensive Western country? In any case, this deserves to be studied in depth.","Not all clothes go in the dryer anyway. Yes we do for most of the clothes and we are not bothered because we have the space to do it.

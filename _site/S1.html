<h3>The Atomic Habits case study</h3>
<p>‘Atomic Habits’ refers to a book written by James Clear, published in
2018. The full title of the book is <em>Atomic Habits: An Easy &amp;
Proven Way to Build Good Habits &amp; Break Bad Ones</em>. The book
focuses on the idea that making small, incremental changes to our habits
can lead to significant improvements in our lives over time.</p>
<p>The term ‘atomic’ in this context refers to the concept of breaking
habits down into their smallest, indivisible components. Just as atoms
are the fundamental building blocks of matter, small habits are the
fundamental building blocks of personal development and behavior change.
The book draws from scientific research, psychology, and real-life
examples to explain how habits work and how individuals can harness the
power of habits to transform their lives.</p>
<p>In our study, participants were given a list of ten habits to
implement in their daily lives. By understanding the difficulties and
constraints of implementation, how habits are perceived and why they are
perceived as they are, we can suggest ways to change behaviour.</p>
<p>The questionnaire regarding the perception of the ten habits was
composed of three sections.</p>
<p>The first section of the questionnaire was about the possibility of
implementing the habit. If the participant thought the habit could be
done in the near future, or if they had already started doing it, they
would answer ‘Yes’. If they did not think it was possible to do the
habit in the near future, they would answer ‘No’.</p>
<p>In the second section of the questionnaire, participants were asked
to indicate the degree of constraint they would experience in performing
the habit. This was answered on a scale from 0 to 5.</p>
<p>The third section asked for the reasons for their answers and would
give us a more thorough explanation of their answers, giving us more
insight into the perceived difficulty of these habits.</p>
<p>In this session we will look at the analysis and visualisation of the
first and second sections of the questionnaire. We will try to deepen
our understanding of the implementation and limitation of the ten
habits.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-analysis-and-visualisation" class="section level3">
<h3>Data analysis and visualisation</h3>
<div id="do-you-feel-capable-of" class="section level4">
<h4>Do you feel capable of…?</h4>
<div id="some-numerical-indicators" class="section level5">
<h5>Some numerical indicators</h5>
<p>As mentioned, ten atomic habits were evaluated:</p>
<ul>
<li>never drive alone (<em>car_alone</em>)</li>
<li>never take the plane (<em>never_airplane</em>)</li>
<li>use equipment loan systems rather than buying (<em>loaner</em>)</li>
<li>buy only second hand clothes (<em>clothes_second</em>)</li>
<li>buy only bulk products (<em>bulk</em>)</li>
<li>buy only local products (<em>local_products</em>)</li>
<li>switch off plugged-in appliances instead of leaving them on standby
(<em>unplug</em>)</li>
<li>lower the temperature in your home by 1 degree
(<em>low_temperature</em>)</li>
<li>adopt a strictly plant-based diet (<em>vegetarian</em>)</li>
<li>air-dry your washing (<em>air_drying</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The first question was: <em>do you feel capable of…?</em>. The first
part of the data consists of yes or no answers. In other words, it is
binary data. What can we do with this data? Firstly, we can understand
the difficulty of implementation by looking at the frequency of yes or
no answers.</p>
<pre><code>##  car_alone never_airplane loaner    clothes_second  bulk     local_products
##  Yes:79    Yes:81         Yes:151   Yes:95         Yes:118   Yes:89        
##  No :88    No :86         No : 16   No :72         No : 49   No :78        
##  unplug    low_temperature vegetarian air_drying
##  Yes:144   Yes:145         Yes: 39    Yes:154   
##  No : 23   No : 22         No :128    No : 13</code></pre>
<p>Looking at these results, we can see that the proportions of yes and
no answers are different from one habit to the other. If the proportion
of ‘no’ answers is higher, more people find this habit more difficult to
implement. Therefore, if we organise the order of these habits according
to the proportion of ‘no’ answers, we can see which habits are harder to
implement than others.</p>
<pre><code>##                 Yes  No
## vegetarian       39 128
## car_alone        79  88
## never_airplane   81  86
## local_products   89  78
## clothes_second   95  72
## bulk            118  49
## unplug          144  23
## low_temperature 145  22
## loaner          151  16
## air_drying      154  13</code></pre>
<p>If we rearrange the habits according to the frequency of responses,
we can see that becoming a vegetarian and never using a car when alone
are the hardest habits to implement. We can also see that air-drying
laundry and using a loan system for items are easier to implement.</p>
</div>
<div id="some-graphical-representations" class="section level5">
<h5>Some graphical representations</h5>
<p>R comes with a number of functions that you can use by default, but
you can use a wider range of functions by using packages. R packages are
collections of R functions, code, and data that are easy to install and
use. When you first open R, the R console has only the default packages.
But by installing and loading other packages using respectively the
<code>install.packages()</code> and <code>library()</code> functions, we
have access to more functions. Let’s represent our data with the
<code>ggplot2</code> package.</p>
<p>The data we have compiled is the frequency of responses for each
habit. This type of data can be visualised using bar charts. Bar chart
and bar plot are terms often used interchangeably, and they both refer
to graphical representations of categorical data using rectangular bars.
Let’s start by visualising the habit that was considered the easiest to
implement.</p>
<p><img src="S1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Through this bar plot we can see that the frequency of the answer
‘Yes’ is much higher than ‘No’, meaning that the habit of air drying
your laundry is found implementable for a lot of people. Now let’s look
at the habit that was considered most difficult to implement.</p>
<p><img src="S1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Unlike the previous habit, the habit of becoming vegetarian had a
higher frequency of the answer ‘No’. This shows that the implementation
of this habit is difficult to implement.</p>
<p>In order to effectively compare the proportions of these two habits,
we can standardize the y axis and put these graphs side by side.</p>
<p><img src="S1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>From this comparison we can see that the difference in proportions is
more extreme for the habit of air-drying than for becoming
vegetarian.</p>

<div id="i-find-this-habit" class="section level4">
<h4>I find this habit…</h4>
<div id="some-numerical-indicators-1" class="section level5">
<h5>Some numerical indicators</h5>
<p>The second part of the data concerns the restrictiveness score for
the ten habits: <em>I find this habit: 0, not restrictive - 5, very
restrictive</em>. With this data we can understand the quantitative
level of constraint perceived by the participants for the ten habits. A
rudimentary analysis can be done by calculating the mean of the scores
for each habit. Let’s look at this first.</p>
<pre><code>##       car_alone_score  never_airplane_score          loaner_score 
##                   3.1                   2.7                   1.7 
##  clothes_second_score            bulk_score  local_products_score 
##                   2.3                   2.4                   2.7 
##          unplug_score low_temperature_score      vegetarian_score 
##                   1.6                   1.5                   3.6 
##      air_drying_score 
##                   1.1</code></pre>
<p>Looking at the mean values of the scores, we can see that the habits
have different mean values, which shows that the amount of constraint
the participants perceive the habit to be is different. Just as with the
previous binary data, we can rearrange the results to understand them
better.</p>
<pre><code>##      vegetarian_score       car_alone_score  never_airplane_score 
##                   3.6                   3.1                   2.7 
##  local_products_score            bulk_score  clothes_second_score 
##                   2.7                   2.4                   2.3 
##          loaner_score          unplug_score low_temperature_score 
##                   1.7                   1.6                   1.5 
##      air_drying_score 
##                   1.1</code></pre>
<p>By rearranging habits by mean values we can see which habits are more
constraining than others. We can also see that out of the habits,
becoming vegetarian is the most constraining, while air drying is the
least constraining.</p>
</div>
<div id="some-graphical-representations-1" class="section level5">
<h5>Some graphical representations</h5>
<p>The mean of the scores gives a good summary of the level of
restriction, but it does not fully explain the data we have. Even if two
habits have similar mean scores, this does not mean that the
distribution of perceptions is the same. Some habits may have a fairly
even distribution of scores, while some others may have a skewed
distribution. The distribution of scores is visualised using a
histogram. A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution
of a dataset. It is used to display the underlying frequency
distribution of a set of continuous or discrete data.</p>
<p><img src="S1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Now that we can see the distributions of the scores, we can have a
deeper understanding of the scores. For example, the habit of using only
local products (<em>local_products_score</em>) and never taking a plane
(<em>never_airplane_score</em>) have the same mean of 2.7, but they have
a different distribution.</p>
<p>For the habit of using local products, the score responses were more
heavily distributed between 2 and 4, indicating that the majority of
participants perceived this habit to be similarly constraining. However,
for the habit of never flying, the distribution was more even,
suggesting that for some participants this habit was not perceived as
constraining at all, while for others it was very constraining.</p>
<p>In this session we have analysed categorical and continuous data and
also presented this analysis in a more effective way by visualising the
data. In the next session we will look more closely at the score data to
deepen our understanding.</p>
